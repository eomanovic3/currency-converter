#Requirements

## Done 
For backend use Node.js with any common framework (express,
hapi, koa and serverless are all recommended) . 
Your API can be based on REST or GraphQL
For frontend we prefer React but you can also use other
modern frameworks
In the backend, use an external API to get the currency
rates.
The frontend has to communicate only with your custom API.
The app should also display the following stats:
Most popular destination currency
Total amount converted (in USD)
Total number of conversion requests made

Your app should not require any pre-requisites. It should
run on any machine with latest LTS version of Node.
Alternatively you can create a Docker image.

## Not Done 
Make sure the stats are not cleared on restart and are
aggregate for all visitors. This means they have to be
calculated and stored in the backend.
Do not use locally installed database. You can use local
file, free version of some cloud database or any other
method.


## Used 
Try to use ES6+ and/or typescript
Split the code into several modules. Don’t use just one file
for the Node server.

When building the API, consider it public. Other developers
might use it so make sure it's understandable, validate
inputs, etc.
Submit your work as a Git repo. Commit often as you work.
Make your work production-ready
Expect the app will be later developed further by someone
else. Write your code with that in mind.
